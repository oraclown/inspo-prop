Mostly frontend:
- make "new entry" button display form on new page that user can fill out to add new row entry
- render expiry and created times in human-readable current time for the user
- add sort by expiry
- add sort by created at
- click to edit any row
- sort by tags (include / exclude)
- sort by status (open, accepted, rejected)
- text search that includes titles, descriptions, & outcome
- update favicon to uppercase R

Including backend:
- add entry button sends new row to db
- rows are rendered from database

Later:
- add profiles for each user
- store data for each user
- spec out analytics part of the dashboard (num rejections etc per wk, month, yr charts, named entity recognition over time, etc.)
- make email signups or google signups
- make signups require monthly stripe payment
- add professional square theme choices (light / dark mode)
